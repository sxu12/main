## About Me

Shengjie Xu received a Ph.D. degree in Computer Engineering from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, an M.S. degree in Telecommunications from the University of Pittsburgh, and a B.E. degree in Information Security. He is currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Cyber, Intelligence, and Information Operations of the College of Applied Science and Technology at the University of Arizona (UA). Before joining UA, he was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Management Information Systems of the Fowler College of Business at San Diego State University (SDSU) from 2022 to 2024, and an Assistant Professor in the Beacom College of Computer and Cyber Sciences at Dakota State University (DSU) from 2019 to 2022.

His research interests include cybersecurity, secure AI/machine learning, cryptography, robust intelligent systems, and critical infrastructure protection. He serves as a Technical Editor for the IEEE Wireless Communications and an editor for the International Journal of Sensor Networks. He has received several research and training grants from the U.S. National Science Foundation. He is the lead author of the book “Cybersecurity in Intelligent Networking Systems” (John Wiley/IEEE Press, 2023). He is the recipient of the Outstanding Faculty Award at San Diego State University in 2024, the IET Journals Premium Award for Best Paper in 2020, the Milton E. Mohr Graduate Fellowship Award at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 2017, and the Best Poster Award at the 11th International Conference on the Design of Reliable Communication Networks (DRCN) in 2015. He is a member of IEEE and ACM. He holds multiple professional certifications in cybersecurity and computer networking.
