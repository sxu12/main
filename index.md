## About Me

I am an assistant professor in the College of Information Science at the University of Arizona (U of A). I received a PhD in Computer Engineering from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 2019, an M.S. degree in Telecommunications from the University of Pittsburgh in 2014, and a B.E. degree in Computer Science in 2012. Before joining the U of A, he was an assistant professor at San Diego State University from 2022 to 2024 and at Dakota State University from 2019 to 2022.

My research interests span cybersecurity, AI/machine learning for cybersecurity, secure edge AI and edge computing. I am the lead author of the book *Cybersecurity in Intelligent Networking Systems* (John Wiley/IEEE Press, 2023) and have published more than 40 peer-reviewed articles. I currently serve as a Technical Editor for *IEEE Wireless Communications* and an Associate Editor for *IEEE Access*. I will serve as a Symposium Co-Chair for the Communication and Information System Security Symposium at the *IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)* 2026. My previous roles include serving as Editor for the *International Journal of Sensor Networks* and as Technical Program Committee (TPC) Vice Chair for the *International Symposium on Intelligent Computing and Networking (ISICN)* 2025. My research and educational projects have received support from the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and other funding agencies. I have also served as a proposal panel reviewer for the NSF.

I am a Senior Member of IEEE and hold multiple professional certifications in cybersecurity and computer networking.
